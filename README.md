# My Express App

This is my ongoing, tweaked boilerplate way of using expressjs.

- uses coffee-script
- mocha, should and zombie for testing
- includes contrib client-side stuff
  - angularjs
  - angularfire
  - bootstrap
  - firebase
  - jquery

Get it.

    git clone git@github.com:msmithgu/my-express.git

Continuously run tests on it.

    make tester

Serve it for yourself.

    make serve

Edit as you will.
